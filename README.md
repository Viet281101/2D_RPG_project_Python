This is also one of my python learning projects, I put it on github to do Backup and clean up my computer's hard drive.

- To run this project you need to install the _'pygame'_:
```
~$ pip3 install pygame
```
or using this one:
```
~$ sudo apt-get install python-pygame
```
 

- And open the _"./script/main.py"_ file:

```
~$ python3 main.py
```


**KEY GAME:**

'**CTRL**' (left) to use magic
'**M**' to open the Menu Attribute
